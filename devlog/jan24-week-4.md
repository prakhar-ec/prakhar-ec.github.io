Jan 22 - Jan 28<br>
Week#: 04/52<br>


## Monday

- Started of at ****9:00 AM**, reviewed the comment that Ab made on my PR and made the changes accordingly. He also assigned me many issues so I went through them and commented what I thought could be a plan of action.
- Got on a meet with Ab at **11:40 AM** and discussed the issues out. I formulated a rough plan of action on how I will implement the feature or fix the bug.
- Getting started on the issues one by one. My thought process is - Work on one issue and refactor the second thread. More than two threads may or may not affect the efficiency.
- Just fixed a multipartitionbug wherein the partitions were being added with respect to the Box as whole and not the section. Had to fetch the section parameters for this to work.
- Now working on Toggle single select, this doesn't sound that hard since changing the element from single to just fixed single shouldn't be that tough.
- Just came to know that the toggle also uses various handler functions so I have to modify them too to make use of strings.
- Made all the changes in the ToggleGroup, now it enables only single group selection and removed the extra props.
- Also made a lot of changes in the Materials file since all the Material filters had to be modified to support string|undefined and not arrays.
- I've pushed the changes and commited the PR.
- Now I'll look into working on the sharing access, try on the UI modal first.
- Had the review meet at **9:30 PM**.
