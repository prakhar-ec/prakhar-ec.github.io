Dec 01 - Jan 07<br>
Week#: 01/52<br>

## Monday

- Had the Orientation meet at 12 PM and that's it for todays day, office begins tomorrow.
- Read a book to get myself to increase my attention span. 

## Tuesday


### What have I done since the last log?
- Started off at 9:00 AM sharp. Began with importing the SQL dumb.
- Ab had Sent the 3rd SQL dumb for materials. Loading the tables worked, the items are now available in 3D.
- Trying to evaluate the cause of the `TypeError: can't convert undefined to object` when trying to use the TV Set for 3D rendering.
- I tried tracing back the issue from the back the error actually arrives from TV set being returned as undefined.
- Ab asked to create a flowchart for the working of Furniture loading - added as much info as I could in it.
- Made some corrections as suggested and improved readability. 
- Sat on a meet with Ab to find the issue. I need to bring in more efficiency. Was relying on console.logs more than browser debugging. Was able to trace back the issue to the json file itself.
- Fixed the issue and the rendering works. For now the console is free from errors.
- Started working on documentation to prepare a documentation of the tables of the database that are being used.


### Any problems or Blockers?
- Trying to understand the tables as a whole and prepare relationship between each other.

### What's next for tomorrow?
- Will try and complete the mapping of atleast one table today and get approved. Then move on to prepare the rest of them.
- Complete a full testing of the frontend in another thread to make sure there aren't any other render issues.
