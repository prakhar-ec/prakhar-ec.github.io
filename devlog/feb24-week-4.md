Feb 19 - Feb 23<br>
Week#: 08/52<br>

## Monday

Starting at 08:15AM

- I'll try and merge the PR as well as start a new Issue.
- 08:30AM - Starting with issue #155.
- 10:30AM - Decided weather it would be a better idea to make a seperate page or component for the Customer view ( went with a new page)
- 12:00PM - Added the 3D view for the project. Will try testing, adding the logo and adding a redirect for just customers or people with view access.
- 02:30PM - I had coded the redirects and logo on the customer view. But was facing errors due the flow change, looked into it and made the PR.
- 03:00PM - The PR is done, the only thing left is to enable users that are not logged in so that they can easily view the projects.
