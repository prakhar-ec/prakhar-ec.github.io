Week#: 51/52<br>


## Monday

- Did basic Work Log setup and other system settings.

## Tuesday

- Started off with a short call with Ab to setup the docs and run basic configurations.
- Got a note of what would be the major task and how I might go around doing it.
- Tried setting up the dev environment on my own while following the docs.
- Ran into some permission issues in docker and had to use `chown`.
- The day passed by trying to get the containers work which kept failing.

<br />

## Wednesday

- Picked up where I left yesterday. Had to make the containers work somehow.
- Was consulting Ab parallely while working trying to get things done.
- Did a deep dive into Volumes and Mounts and how they work, difference between volume and binds what to use when.
- Finally made the containers work.
- Turns out I had to grant folder permission from docker desktop too.
- Used SQL commands to create the tables and fill them up provided by Ab.
- The website lets me create a new project but having error while adding components. Will start debugging now.
- Parallely added a Getting-Started.md page to setup the containers and get them working.
