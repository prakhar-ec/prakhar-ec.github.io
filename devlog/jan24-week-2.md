Dec 01 - Jan 07<br>
Week#: 01/52<br>

## Monday

- Had the Orientation meet at 12 PM and that's it for todays day, office begins tomorrow.
- Read a book to get myself to increase my attention span.

## Tuesday


### What have I done since the last log?
- Started off at 9:00 AM sharp. Began with importing the SQL dumb.
- Ab had Sent the 3rd SQL dumb for materials. Loading the tables worked, the items are now available in 3D.
- Trying to evaluate the cause of the `TypeError: can't convert undefined to object` when trying to use the TV Set for 3D rendering.
- I tried tracing back the issue from the back the error actually arrives from TV set being returned as undefined.
- Ab asked to create a flowchart for the working of Furniture loading - added as much info as I could in it.
- Made some corrections as suggested and improved readability.
- Sat on a meet with Ab to find the issue. I need to bring in more efficiency. Was relying on console.logs more than browser debugging. Was able to trace back the issue to the json file itself.
- Fixed the issue and the rendering works. For now the console is free from errors.
- Started working on documentation to prepare a documentation of the tables of the database that are being used.


### Any problems or Blockers?
- Trying to understand the tables as a whole and prepare relationship between each other.

### What's next for tomorrow?
- Will try and complete the mapping of atleast one table today and get approved. Then move on to prepare the rest of them.
- Complete a full testing of the frontend in another thread to make sure there aren't any other render issues.


## Wednesday


### What have I done since the last log?
- Started in the Morning. The aim was to have the Code Review for both PRs today.
- I was trying to clean up on the PR, trying to add up the conventions and follow the naming convention.
- I was also reviewing the code and looking at how we can merge the compoonents, for the Search Bar, the Results and the preview.
- Ab also assigned me the task to drwa the heirarchy for the Svelte Components.
- We did the review for the first PR and I had to remove the onMount, remove trailing spaces, add space convention etc.


### Any problems or Blockers?
- Trying to merge the two components, I am having trouble trying to make use of already existing code and components - don't want to disturb the already existing code.

### What's next for tomorrow?
- Work on the second PR with the changes.
- Try to get on the code review with ab and get review on that.

## Thursday


### What have I done since the last log?
- I worked on the second PR, and added the space convention, renamed variables etc.
- I got the task of combinging the SearchBar, the Results and the preview in the best way possible.
- We did the code review for 3 hours and tried debugging wherever we felt and error.
- This went on for long followed by overviewing the changes and I took and implemented the feedback.


### Any problems or Blockers?
- Getting the 2nd PR merged and working.

### What's next for tomorrow?
- Close the Secone PR. It's taking way long than expected!


## FRIDAY

### What have I done since the last log?

- Started off the morning with a meet. We wanted to close down the PR for the second issue on the day itself.
- Ab had thought of stripping the code from the js files and moving it to the UI itself.
- I worked on moving the functions and appropriate variables to the UI components themselves.
- We sat on the Meet for several hours to actually properly work on the PR.
- Apart from various code conventions which I kept missing the idea was really fuzzy, what to keep what not to keep, and a lot of code refactoring.
- I completed the code and made the space conventions too, hoping the PR works and it gets merged.
- Friday's end in the evening itself so we'll finally close the PR on Monday itself.

### Any Problems or Blockers?
